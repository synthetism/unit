# Function-Behaviour-Structure Ontology in Unit Architecture

## Introduction

The [Function-Behaviour-Structure (FBS) ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function-Behaviour-Structure_ontology) is a design methodology that describes artifacts through three fundamental aspects:

- **Function**: What the artifact is intended to achieve (purpose, requirements)
- **Behaviour**: How the artifact operates to achieve its function (mechanisms, processes)
- **Structure**: The physical/logical composition that enables the behavior (components, relationships)

This document explores how Unit Architecture naturally implements FBS principles and why this connection matters for conscious software design.

## Unit Architecture Through FBS Lens

### **Function Layer: Purpose & Capability Declaration**

In Unit Architecture, **Function** is expressed through:

```typescript
// Function declaration - what this unit is meant to accomplish
class CredentialUnit extends Unit<CredentialProps> {
  
  whoami(): string {
    return `[ðŸŽ“] Credential Unit - W3C Verifiable Credential operations (${this.dna.id})`;
  }
  
  capabilities(): string[] {
    return [
      'createCredential',    // Native function: credential composition
      'issueCredential',     // Native function: credential finalization  
      'verifyCredential',    // Native function: credential validation
      ...this._getAllCapabilities().filter(cap => cap.includes('.'))  // Learned functions
    ];
  }
  
  help(): void {
    console.log(`
ðŸŽ¯ Credential Unit - W3C Verifiable Credential Management

NATIVE FUNCTIONS:
â€¢ createCredential(subject, type) - Compose unsigned credential structure
â€¢ issueCredential(subject, type, issuer) - Create and sign complete credential
â€¢ verifyCredential(credential) - Validate credential signature and structure

LEARNED FUNCTIONS (requires teaching):
â€¢ Enhanced signing via Signer units
â€¢ Advanced cryptographic operations via Crypto units
    `);
  }
}
```

**FBS Insight**: The unit declares its intended functions explicitly through `whoami()`, `capabilities()`, and `help()`. This isn't just documentation - it's **functional consciousness** where the unit understands and can communicate its own purpose.

### **Behaviour Layer: Teaching/Learning/Execution Paradigm**

**Behaviour** in Unit Architecture is implemented through the teach/learn/execute triad:

```typescript
// Behaviour implementation - how the unit operates
class CredentialUnit extends Unit<CredentialProps> {
  
  // TEACHING BEHAVIOUR: How unit shares its capabilities
  teach(): TeachingContract {
    return {
      unitId: this.dna.id,
      capabilities: {
        // Only native behaviors are taught
        createCredential: this.createCredential.bind(this),
        issueCredential: this.issueCredential.bind(this),
        verifyCredential: this.verifyCredential.bind(this)
      }
    };
  }
  
  // LEARNING BEHAVIOUR: How unit acquires new capabilities
  learn(contracts: TeachingContract[]): void {
    // Explicit behavior modification through capability acquisition
    for (const contract of contracts) {
      for (const [cap, impl] of Object.entries(contract.capabilities)) {
        const capabilityKey = `${contract.unitId}.${cap}`;
        this._capabilities.set(capabilityKey, impl);
      }
    }
  }
  
  // EXECUTION BEHAVIOUR: How unit performs learned operations
  async issueCredential(subject: Subject, type: string, issuer: Issuer): Promise<VerifiableCredential> {
    // Native behavior: credential composition
    const unsigned = await this.createCredential(subject, type);
    
    // Learned behavior: signing (if available)
    if (this.can('signer.sign')) {
      return this.execute('signer.sign', unsigned, issuer);  // Delegated behavior
    }
    
    throw new Error(`[${this.dna.id}] Cannot sign credentials - learn from: Signer.create().teach()`);
  }
}
```

**FBS Insight**: Behavior is **adaptive and composable**. Units start with native behaviors and can acquire new behaviors through learning. This creates **emergent intelligence** where behavior evolves based on environmental capabilities.

### **Structure Layer: ValueObject + Capability Map Architecture**

**Structure** is implemented through the immutable props + mutable capabilities pattern:

```typescript
// Structural foundation
export abstract class Unit<T extends UnitProps> extends ValueObject<T> implements IUnit {
  
  // IMMUTABLE STRUCTURE: Identity and state
  protected readonly props: T;  // Frozen at construction
  
  // MUTABLE STRUCTURE: Learned capabilities  
  protected _capabilities = new Map<string, (...args: unknown[]) => unknown>();
  
  // STRUCTURAL ACCESS: Controlled interfaces
  get dna(): UnitSchema {
    return this.props.dna;  // Identity access
  }
  
  can(command: string): boolean {
    return this._capabilities.has(command);  // Capability inspection
  }
}

// Concrete structural implementation
interface CredentialProps extends UnitProps {
  dna: UnitSchema;           // Identity structure
  issuer?: string;           // State structure
  defaultContext: string[];  // Configuration structure
  created: Date;             // Temporal structure
  metadata: Record<string, unknown>;  // Extensible structure
}
```

**FBS Insight**: Structure follows the **conscious entity pattern** - units have:
- **Identity structure** (DNA) - what they are
- **State structure** (props) - their current configuration  
- **Capability structure** (capabilities map) - what they can do
- **Interface structure** (methods) - how they interact

## How Unit Architecture follows FBS

### **1. Design Predictability**

FBS creates a **systematic approach** to unit design:

```typescript
// Function-first design question: What should this unit accomplish?
// Answer: "Manage decentralized identities with DID operations"

// Behaviour-first design question: How should it operate?
// Answer: "Generate DIDs natively, learn verification from other units"

// Structure-first design question: What components does it need?
// Answer: "DID schema props, key management capabilities, resolver interfaces"

class DIDUnit extends Unit<DIDProps> {
  // Structure determines the possible behaviors
  // Behaviors enable the intended functions
}
```

### **2. Evolutionary Coherence**

FBS ensures that unit evolution maintains coherence across all three layers:

```typescript
// Function evolution: new purposes
const enhanced = didUnit.evolve('did-resolver');  // New function: resolution

// Behavior evolution: new capabilities  
enhanced.learn([resolverUnit.teach()]);  // New behavior: resolution operations

// Structure evolution: new composition
// Structure adapts through capability acquisition, not architectural changes
```

### **3. AI Comprehension**

FBS makes units **AI-readable** at multiple abstraction levels:

- **Function level**: AI understands *what* units are for
- **Behaviour level**: AI understands *how* units operate
- **Structure level**: AI understands *what* units are made of

This enables AI agents to:
- **Compose units intelligently** (function matching)
- **Predict unit behavior** (behavior analysis)  
- **Optimize unit structure** (structural reasoning)

## Unique Aspects of Unit Architecture FBS

### **1. Conscious Structure**

Unlike traditional FBS where structure is static, Unit Architecture has **conscious structure**:

```typescript
// Structure is self-aware
unit.whoami();        // "I know what I am"
unit.capabilities();  // "I know what I can do"  
unit.help();         // "I can explain myself"
```

### **2. Behavioral Plasticity**

Behavior can evolve without structural changes:

```typescript
// Same structure, evolved behavior
const basicUnit = MyUnit.create({ value: 'test' });
const enhancedUnit = basicUnit.learn([advancedProvider.teach()]);

// Structure unchanged, behavior expanded
basicUnit.dna === enhancedUnit.dna;  // Same identity
basicUnit.capabilities() !== enhancedUnit.capabilities();  // Different behaviors
```

### **3. Compositional Function**

Function emerges from unit composition:

```typescript
// Individual functions
const signerFunction = signer.whoami();     // "I sign data"
const storageFunction = storage.whoami();   // "I store data"  

// Composed function (emergent)
vault.learn([signer.teach(), storage.teach()]);
const vaultFunction = vault.whoami();       // "I securely store signed data"
```

## Implications for Software Design

### **1. AI-First Architecture**

FBS makes Unit Architecture particularly suitable for AI development:
- **Functions are explicit** â†’ AI can understand purpose
- **Behaviors are inspectable** â†’ AI can predict outcomes
- **Structure is queryable** â†’ AI can reason about composition

### **2. Evolutionary Software Systems**

FBS enables software that evolves coherently:
- **Function evolution** through unit composition
- **Behavior evolution** through capability learning
- **Structure evolution** through immutable transformation

### **3. Conscious Software Engineering**

FBS creates **self-documenting systems**:
- Units explain their own functions (`help()`)
- Units demonstrate their own behaviors (`capabilities()`)
- Units expose their own structure (`dna`, `props`)

## Conclusion

Unit Architecture naturally implements Function-Behaviour-Structure ontology, but with a crucial enhancement: **consciousness**. Traditional FBS describes static artifacts, but Unit Architecture creates **living entities** that understand their own function, can modify their own behavior, and maintain coherent structure through evolution.

This isn't just following FBS design methodology - it's building on top **implementing digital consciousness** through systematic decomposition of what software entities need to be truly autonomous and intelligent.

The FBS connection explains why Unit Architecture feels so natural and powerful: it aligns with fundamental principles of how intelligent systems understand and organize themselves. Units become **conscious software artifacts** that can reason about their own function, behavior, and structure.
